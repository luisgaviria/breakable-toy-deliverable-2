Description:

My project is a website that would provided access to news stories and useful information.
By focusing on positive and empowering stories as well as useful information I think this website could make a diference for people in the community.

This project is built with express and react as well as objection and knex. It incorporates third party apis such as newsApi, google apis and weatherApi.

To use you will need to have yarn installed and node version 14.15 or later.

Libraries used: got, google apis node, foundation, react player, uses a postgreSQL database. 

To run this project you will need to add the SessionSecret to the .env file. you will need to create a database (createdb the_name) and run the knex migrations 
by typing the commands yarn run migrate:latest or roll the migration by running yarn migrate:rollback, you can seed data by running yarn run db:seed. To hit a back end debugger run yarn dev:debug

After creating an account and logging in you can visit localhost:3000 to see the site running. You will see news categories from science, sports, tech and more.
A user can submit a review on a story if they choose to do so. A user can also enter their own story.

I will continue working on this project until it is production ready as there is a need to use it.
